# Marvel Mods File Cleanup batch file
This batch file helps clean up your game files before you start installing mods. 

## Compatibility
XML2 PC, MUA1 PC

## Usage

 1. Place the batch file anywhere. If you place it in your game folder, it will automatically detect the folder when the program is run. If it's not in the game folder, you will be asked for the file path when running the script. 
 2. Run the batch file by double clicking. You will be asked which game you're using. Select the appropriate game.
 3. XML2 only: You will be asked if you want to change file extensions and folder names to lowercase. This is optional and doesn't impact gameplay. It's a visual change only. 
 4. The batch file will perform the selected operations. 
 5. Press any key when the batch file announces that the operations are complete.
