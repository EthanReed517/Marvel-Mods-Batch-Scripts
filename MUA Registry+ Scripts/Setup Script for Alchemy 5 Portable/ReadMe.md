Instructions:
Run Setup.bat with Administrator rights.
  - If the command window doesn't open (flashes only), there is a problem with the current path.
    In this case, run Setup.bat from a NEW [elevated command prompt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK6jJFsLnqY), and:
    Type the path and name of the Setup BAT, including double-quotes, eg. `"C:\Alchemy\Setup.bat"`, and press enter.
  - Associate IGB files with Finalizer (view and modify content as text), Insight viewer (view IGB visually), or not, as you want.
This allows Alchemy batches/tools to run correctly, and associates IGB files with the Alchemy 5 Finalizer.

Hints:
If you move Alchemy Portable to a different folder, you can run Setup.bat again to update the information.
If you want to remove Alchemy Portable, you can run Setup.bat - if it is registered, you can choose to uninstall it.
A reboot or login may be required for the dll libraries to register correctly (path variable).
